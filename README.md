This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Docker Setup

To run this project using Docker, ensure you have Docker installed. You can follow the installation instructions on the official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for your Next.js project, run the following command:

````bash
docker build -t animated-portfolio .

## Running the Docker Container

After building the image, run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker compose up --build

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

If you make any changes to the code, you'll need to rebuild the Docker image and relaunch the container.
